      <p>What challenges do family caregivers face and how can you help them as a healthcare provider? Perhaps you mentioned wondering how to help them access resources, how to address their emotional pain, or how to balance this new role along with their other work and family obligations, or how to help them learn to ask for help.</p>

      <p>As a health care professional, you play a critical role in facilitating communication among the patient, family caregiver, and other family members. </p>

      <p>This module is one of several that is designed to provide you with the tools for supporting family caregivers. In it, we equip you with tools and strategies for communicating successfully with patients, family caregivers, and other family members during these times of distress and uncertainty.</p>

      <p>After completing the module, you will be able to:</p>

      <ol class="flush">
        <li>Describe family communication patterns for caregivers.</li>
        <li>Identify and define each caregiver type (Manager, Carrier, Partner, Lone).</li>
        <li>Respond appropriately when communicating with caregivers and their families.</li>
      </ol>
