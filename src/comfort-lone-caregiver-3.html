Kai’s adult children do not feel obligated to be part of his care and thus family members rarely talk about the disease with one another and refuse to talk with Keith. Conversations about Kai are essentially non-existent among family members."

While Keith can talk to Kai about medical treatment, he is unable to talk to him about future decisions, the stress of caregiving, and his disappointment in his sibling-in-laws. Kai struggles with the family’s lack of participation and inattention to Kai. Keith also has difficulty communicating with healthcare providers and does not ask providers to further explain medical treatments so that he can understand."

Keith needs one-on-one support, someone who will listen and help him process the frustration over an absentee family. Keith needs information given in simple, clear terms, through pictures or videos, so that he can share it with Kai."
