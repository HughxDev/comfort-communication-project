      <p><dfn>Carrier caregivers</dfn> tend to surrender to the pressures of family authority and pressures to conform to the patient’s wishes over their own self-care needs. They typically come from a low-talk and high obligation family. Carrier caregivers shoulder the burden of responsibility as they shelter other family members from it. They are unlikely to disclose their needs to other family members and avoid discussions about death and dying. They seek affirmation from clinical staff about decision-making and caregiving. They welcome opportunities to self-disclose with healthcare providers because they cannot do so with their families. They might say, for example,</p>

      <p><q>I don’t want to say anything to them [other family members] because I don’t want to stir up anything and have mom [the patient] get upset. So I just kind of gripe to my husband about it which I don’t even like doing that. But at least he’ll listen.</q></p>

      <p>Carrier caregivers tend to suffer from burnout and depression as they attempt to shoulder the burden of responsibility for caring for the patient, not feeling much of a support network in the family, and neglecting to care for themselves in the process of caring for the patient.</p>

      <p><b>How to spot a carrier caregiver:</b> You can spot a carrier caregiver because they will usually ask lots of questions and rarely challenge the answers. They trust the decisions and suggestions of the healthcare professionals. They will self-disclose to the clinical staff and seek affirmation from them. They do not discuss death and dying or their own burdens with family members.</p>

      <p><b>Communication Strategies:</b> Address caregiver burden with the clinical team so all understand what the caregiver is experiencing and all can encourage the caregiver to share responsibilities with other family members, as well as stress the importance of self-care. Explain and advocate their use of support resources available to them. Provide affirmation and support to them for the decisions they are making and the care they are providing. Provide opportunities for them to self-disclose about their burdens, stresses, and concerns. Ask questions that remind them to care for themselves too: “What have you done for yourself today?”</p>
