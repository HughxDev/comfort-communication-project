      </header>

      <p><dfn>Manager caregivers</dfn> are at the top of the family hierarchy and appoint themselves to be the family spokesperson. They may be the most formally educated of the family members generally and have the highest health literacy specifically. Managers deal with their own uncertainty by taking control of the communication within the family and with the health care providers. These manager caregivers act as an extension of the physician and dominate conversations about the disease by focusing on their own knowledge of it. As the self-appointed family spokesperson, the manager also makes the decisions and limits opportunities for other family members to ask or answer questions.</p>

      <hr />

      <p><b>How to spot a manager caregiver:</b> You can spot a manager because they are heavily prepared, have studied research on the disease, use medical terminology to illustrate their health literacy, and often bring research material with them to meet healthcare providers. Managers often minimize the illness as a coping mechanism. Finally, managers focus on swift decision-making based on limited discussion. In other words, they privilege action over process.</p>

      <p><b>Communication Strategies:</b> Remember that manager caregivers mean well. Honor the health literacy of the manager caregiver by using medical terminology when talking with them. Because manager caregivers tend to dominate the conversation and limit opportunities for other family members to engage in the discussion, you should moderate the communication exchange by inviting other family members to engage. For example, you can ask them directly what they are worried about and what questions/concerns they have. You should also conduct one-on-one meetings with other family members to provide them opportunities to process their experiences and ask questions without feeling hindered by the presence of the manager caregiver.</p>
