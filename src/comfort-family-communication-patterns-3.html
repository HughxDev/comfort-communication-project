      <p>When a family member is diagnosed with a serious illness, family communication patterns are highlighted by the illness crisis. Healthcare providers experience challenges with family caregivers that stem from the caregiver’s family communication pattern. These challenges arise when family caregivers avoid talk about the disease and the future (low family talk), share strong feelings and cannot agree on a decision (high family talk), willfully exclude certain family members from decision-making (low obligation), and when patient and family hide their feelings from one another (high obligation). To support family caregivers through these challenges, you can learn more about the family caregiver’s communication type and learn to meet their unique communication needs.</p>
