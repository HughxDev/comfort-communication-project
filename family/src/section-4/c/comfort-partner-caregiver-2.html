            "response": "Debbie is a Partner Caregiver, showing high family talk and low conformity. She and David have embraced his cancer diagnosis together by talking openly about his disease, side effects of treatment, and her stress. David is comfortable hearing how different her experience is following chemotherapy treatment, as low conformity patterns allow different perspectives, both good and bad, to be shared."

            "question": "What partner caregiver characteristics does this caregiver display?",
            "response": "As a Partner Caregiver, Debbie talks about the negative aspects of caregiving in front of David (“I get tired of being a nag”) and is not concerned about how this may hurt his feelings. She comfortably talks about how treatment side effects have caused changes in his personality and how these changes have resulted in conflict. Past conflicts are shared openly and resolution is emphasized. She is able to talk about almost any topic in front of him and identifies his confusion and paranoia as being the most challenging aspects of caregiving. Debbie also participates in co-managing David’s medications, resting when he rests, and joins him for clinical visits."

          {
            "question": "What might you say and do if you were on the healthcare team for this caregiver?",
            "response": "Because the two of them openly discuss all aspects of David’s disease, it is important to include Debbie in the process. It will be important to make sure she has what is needed, that support is offered to her, and that the team always meets with the two of them. Share as many resources as possible with Debbie so that she can share additional resources with other members of the family."
