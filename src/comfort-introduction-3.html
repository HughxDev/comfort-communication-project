      <p>Health care professionals do much more than treat patients. Communicating effectively with patients and their families is certainly a major part of the job. For example,</p>

      <p>Consider this…</p>
      
      <div class="scenario">
        <!-- <figure class="align-left">
          <img src="/images/senior-man-in-hat-and-sunglasses.jpg" alt="Senior man in hat and sunglasses" />
          <figcaption>Nick</figcaption>
        </figure> -->
        <p><img class="align-left" src="/images/senior-man-in-hat-and-sunglasses.jpg" alt="Senior man in hat and sunglasses" /> Imagine yourself at work. Lab reports for a patient you have been working with—a 43-year-old woman named Sheila—have come in. The results indicate that Sheila has pancreatic cancer. Pancreatic cancer is most frequently diagnosed in people 65-74 years of age, so this news will probably come as a shock to Sheila and her family. Not only that, only four percent of people diagnosed with pancreatic cancer live to reach the five year survival rate. Sheila and her husband, Nick, have two children. Allyson is 15 and Blake is 10. Shelia’s mom, Dorothy, who is 72 years old and lives with early-stage Alzheimer’s disease, has also been living with them since her husband died two years ago. As you provide day-to-day care for Sheila, a colleague will share this devastating news with Sheila and her family. You wonder what you are going to say when Nick, her husband, asks you about her diagnosis.</p>
      </div>

      <p>Unfortunately, this scenario is not unusual. In many instances, not all members of the healthcare team are present when information is given the patient and family. Few healthcare professionals have been trained adequately in how to communicate with families experiencing life-limiting news effectively. In this module, we walk through each of four caregiver types by (1) explaining the characteristics of the caregiver type, (2) identifying best practices approaches for you to communicate effectively with each of them, and (3) practicing communication based on case study scenarios. But first we lay the foundation by discussing different family communication patterns as they may influence the way families communicate during these times of distress and uncertainty. We hope that approaching family caregiver communication concepts and skills in this way will ultimately prepare you to communicate effectively when you must share bad news with families as they navigate what is, for them, quite possibly uncharted territory.</p>
