        <h2>Case Study</h2>

        <p>Keith is Asian, 51 years old, college educated, and works full-time. He is married and has three children. Keith speaks English as a second language and is the primary caregiver, with assistance from his wife, to his father-in-law, Kai, who recently was diagnosed with lung cancer and has not yet begun treatment. Kai’s diagnosis came by surprise to his family. Despite Kai coming from a large family, Keith repeatedly shared how he has, <q>no support from the family… nobody cares… it’s like [the family] tries to stay away from [Kai’s] problem.</q> None of his sibling-in-laws are willing to provide regular care for Kai. Keith explains that his father-in-law “chose” him to serve as the caregiver: <q>I have been helping him for years.</q> According to Keith: <q>if it is related to medical or his treatment, I tell him everything. But everything else, I just keep to myself.</q></p>

        <p>Keith shares that family members <q>still all rely on me… I try to bring the family together to help.</q> However, every time he reaches out to Kai’s family to provide an update on their father, Keith explains: <q>They don’t care… They never care about anything. [My brother-in-law] said, <q>No,</q> with no reason when asked if he wanted to know how his father is doing.</q></p>
      </section>

      <p>Keith has a hard time communicating with providers and learning about Kai’s disease: <q>I feel that they are too busy or something, and even then sometimes I don’t get enough information.</q> Explanations regarding Kai’s treatments and prognosis are often difficult for Keith to comprehend.</p>
